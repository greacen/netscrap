      <a href="http://www.myfamily.com/" target="NEW">http://www.myfamily.com/</a>
      MyFamily provides 'groups functionality' for The Generations Network sites.
      Their site includes features for users to upload videos and images. To meet
      traffic and usage goals, the portion of the MyFamily service that receives
      and serves video and image content needs to be upgraded. I performed the
      first pass of requirements gathering for this project.

      and myfamily sites.

       sharing sites by launching several sites allowing an editor to quickly update
       content on the site. Our selection process led us toward several blogging
       solutions. We selected roller based on its installation base,

   Meez.com

      Meez.com was voted by Time Magazine as one of the top 5 worst
      web sites on the internet (along with Myspace.com, secondlife.com
      evite.com, and an also-ran). I was the first hire in the QA role and
      helped launch Meez' now multi-million-user site.

       Tomcat as a simpler alternative for our application container.

       starting the build loop and creating visibility into build status I
       helped the team become aware of the impact of their changes. Once we
       integrated even rudimentary tests in the build loop, we were able to
       tackle bigger changes with confidence.

      The Kodak Gallery service (formerly Ofoto, Inc.) served as
      a strategic kingpin for Eastman Kodak's bid to stay relevant
      in a digital imaging future. The service started as Ofoto.com,
      a consumer service for creating high-quality silver-halide
      prints from digital images. The service was extended through
      in-house imaging technologies and 3rd-party fulfillment
      services to have an unparalleled breadth of products. The
      Kodak Gallery service is a highly distributed application in
      which scalability emphasizes uptime and capacity. The service
      receives terabytes of customer data per day. Components that
      make up the service are built with Java, Apache, Resin, Sybase.
      My role at Kodak began as Senior QA Engineer for special
      projects then changed to QA Manager. Here are a few highlights:

      Building the QA Team--
       I created the positions with the QA organization, their roles
       and responsibilities in project work. I hired seven full-time
       engineers, ten hourly technicians to handle the workload.
       Eventually I mapped the roles within my team to the tasks
       that we faced. Positions included project engineers,
       regression testers, automation engineers, automation
       technicians. This allowed the company to match tasks to talent,
       thusly increasing the overall effectiveness of the QA team.
          EXPERIENCE INCLUDED:

       organization I lead the efforts to define a metric program by
       which we attempted to improve QA effectiveness. These measurements
       came from our defect-tracking and the source-control systems.
          METRICS INCLUDED:
            * Deferral rate
            * QA effectiveness
            * Turn-around time for P1 (High-priority) defects

      Global Sourcing Plan--
       As QA Manager I created a plan for handling the workload of a
       maturing company with an intense project schedule. Challenges
       facing the QA department included mounting regression tasks,
       system complexity, budget constraints, limited tool usage

      Photo Greeting Cards-- <A REF="http://www.kodakgallery.com/PGCOverview.jsp" target="NEW">http://www.kodakgallery.com/PGCOverview.jsp</a>
       I tested the launch and revision of Photo Greeting Cards, a
       consumer product using ofoto's advanced imaging technology.
       The web site UI supported a simple set of use cases allowing
       users to create greeting cards using images in their albums.
       PGCs were the first feature to use Ofoto's Imaging Engine
       (OIE) for a customer-facing product. OIE is a java layer and
       open source imaging library (gimp) providing highly efficient
       api to create real-time and nonlinear image edits. Testing
       for this feature included functional and load tests for each
       component, validation of server build-out, asset inspection,
       and browser compatibility. The Photo Greeting Card product is
       the highest grossing merchandise sold through the service.
