			If you're visiting NetScrap.com, then you agree to the following terms of use.
			That's right. This means that you automatically agree to these terms when your
			computer connects to this site! That's pretty cool.
			This agreement is effective until terminated by we or you. You may
			terminate this agreement at any time by discontinuing your use of netscrap.com
			site and destroying all materials obtained from it. But why would
			you want to do that?

			Netscrap.com is made up of various articles. Let's refer to these articles as
			<b>Scrap</b>. (Some of them are <i>Crap</i>, but we digress). Some Scrap are the copyrighted
			property of NetScrap. 	Most however, are not. NetScrap's purpose is to
			tap the META-web (or collective	familiarity people have with each other)
			to find out who owns the Scrap floating around the internet. We try
			whenever possible to credit the original writers and owners of this material.

			reporter doing a little research for a story about us. The reason why we make the
			Scrap available to you is to get your help in determining the original source
			of the Scrap.

			If you're still a little pissed off, please turn on your computer and contact us here at

			Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's

			snack any time of the year. Cookies make Web-surfing easier by, among other
			things, saving your personal info, purchases, and preferences for you. The use of
			cookies is an industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites.
			Since NetScrap.com isn't that major, we know this. But we thought we should let
			you know that netscrap.com will write a small ammount of cookie information for
			you. You can disable this if you want, but we thought we'd save you some time by
			using cookies. That's all we'll say right now.

			Here are some other examples of how Netscrap uses cookies:
			A cookie lets the netscrap.com remember that you've registered, which allows us
			to speed up your future activities at our sites.
			Similarly, if there are any stores within netscrap.com, a temporary cookie
			tracks which products you've selected while shopping. The cookie expires
			once you're done shopping. Letting it do the record-keeping saves you the
			trouble of entering information over and over again during a single visit. If you
			decline this cookie, you may have difficulty ordering your selections.
			Do we sell anything? Not really. But maybe some day.
